## Description 
Welcome to my very own Weather app. Here you will find the ability to search a city, state or country and find the current weather, along with the five day forcast. This project I previously wrote using jQuery, local storage, and Ajax but decided to re-write it using react, sequelize and axios. Have Fun searching your city!
